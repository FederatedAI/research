|[CheXpert](https://stanfordmlgroup.github.io/competitions/chexpert/)|CheXpert is a large dataset of chest X-rays and can be used for vertical federated learning research.|
|[IOFT](https://ioft-data.engin.umich.edu/)|This website was created to serve as central directory for IoFT-based datasets.

## Projects
Currently, we are actively contributing to two projects, [FedML](https://github.com/FedML-AI/FedML) (research-origented) and [FATE](https://github.com/FederatedAI/FATE) (application-oriented).

### [<b>FedML</b>](https://github.com/FedML-AI/FedML)

FedML (Federated Machine Learning) is a research-oriented Federated Learning Library. It provides a plenty of out-of-the-box modules in federated learning, which greatly facilitates the development of new federated learning algorithms for researchers. We are co-contributor to this project and mainly maintain the part of vertical federated learning.

### [<b>FATE</b>](https://github.com/FederatedAI/FATE)

FATE (Federated AI Technology Enabler) is an industrial grade Federated Learning framework. It has already incorporated many of our proposed methods and algorithms to enhance its security and efficiency under various federated learning scenarios. Some of the implemented algorithms are listed below:
